Weissenberg Number for JB is Wi = 2*U*l1
Weissenberg number for LDC is Wi = U*l1

SRTD on the JB is capable of reaching Wi approx 0.1 (e.g. U=0.5, l1 = 0.1)
SRTD on the LDC is capable of reaching Wi approx 0.05 (e.g. U=0.5, l1 = 0.1)
    - roughly, the same U and l1 combination on both problems, SRTD can reach

EVSS on the JB is capable of reaching Wi approx 2.0 (e.g. U=1.0, l1 = 1.0)
EVSS on the LDC is capable of reaching Wi approx 0.45 (e.g. U=0.5, l1 = 0.9)
    - roughly, EVSS can reach twice a parameter value for the JB than it can for LDC
